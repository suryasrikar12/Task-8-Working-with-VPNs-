# Task-8-Working-with-VPNs-
# VPN Setup and Privacy Test

## Objective
To understand VPN functionality, privacy protection, and encryption through hands-on testing using Windscribe VPN.

## Steps Performed
1. Signed up for a free account on [Windscribe](https://windscribe.com/).
2. Downloaded and installed the Windscribe VPN client on Windows.
3. Connected to the **Victoria, Canada** server.
4. Verified IP change using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/).
5. Tested browsing encryption by visiting multiple websites (Wikipedia, YouTube).
6. Disconnected VPN and compared browsing speed and IP.

## Observations
- **Original IP:** 103.203.xxx.xx (Location: India) 
- **VPN IP:** 146.70.25x.xx (Location: Victoria, Canada)
- **Protocol Used:** IKEv2 (Windscribe default)
- **Encryption Standard:** AES-256
- **Note** : IP Address is hidden due to privacy issues

## Benefits of VPN
- Hides real IP address, masking the user's true location.
- Encrypts all internet traffic to protect against eavesdropping.
- Allows bypassing of geographic restrictions and censorship.
- Adds a layer of privacy when using public Wi-Fi.

## Limitations of VPN
- Cannot guarantee 100% anonymity.
- May reduce internet speed due to encryption and routing.
- Free plans have limited server options and bandwidth caps.
- Some websites may block known VPN IP ranges.

## Screenshots
Screenshots are stored in the `screenshots/` folder:
